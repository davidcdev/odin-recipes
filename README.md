# Odin Project: Recipes

In this first project, we implemented the basic HTML structure for a recipe website. 
Created the `index.html`, and the html files for each recipe in a separate folder.
We also created an images folder to save the images for each recipe in the project and used the `<img/>` tag with the `src` and `alt` attributes. 
Added the links to the recipes in the `index.html` with the `<a>` tag with `href` and `target="_blank"` attributes so the other pages can be accessed in a new tab.

Credits to [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/the-best-japanese-snacks-and-small-bites/) which is a suggested source in the project for the recipes and the images.
